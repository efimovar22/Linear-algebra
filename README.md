# Linear-algebra
This project, Linear-algebra, is a collection of notebooks and code exploring various concepts in linear algebra. It is organized into three main folders, each focusing on different aspects of the subject:
1. laba-1: In this folder, extensive research has been conducted on the numpy and scipy libraries. These libraries are widely used for numerical computing and provide efficient tools for working with multidimensional arrays, linear algebra, and scientific computing.

2. laba-2: Here, the focus shifts to studying linear regression. The notebooks in this folder demonstrate how to implement linear regression algorithms and visualize the results using the matplotlib library. Linear regression is a fundamental technique in statistical modeling, which aims to establish a linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

3. laba-3: This folder delves into the concept of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for matrix factorization. SVD is a powerful technique used to decompose matrices into their constituent parts, uncovering valuable insights in applications such as image compression, recommender systems, and data analysis.

By exploring these folders, you will gain practical knowledge of important linear algebra concepts, as well as the ability to apply them to real-world problems using popular Python libraries.
